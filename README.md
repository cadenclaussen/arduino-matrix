    - Rubber bands
    - Spacers
    - 1 layer with 16x16 small squares to mount the LED strips
    - 3 layers with 16x16 squares to create the aperature between the LEDs and the diffused glass
  - Other
    - Scissors/etc to cut the LED strip
    - Piers to pull the nails from the shadow box
    - Laser cutter
    - Sand paper
- [x] LED prep (note the 2812b controller on each LED)
      - Cut the LEDs into 16 strips of 16 LEDs/strip
      - The WS2812 is an RGB LED with a WS2811 control IC built right into the LED
- [x] Creating the arduino sketch in TinkerCad
- [x] Arduino wiring to test each LED strip
- [ ] Integrating the power supply
- [x] Prepping the shadow box
      - Removed glass
      - Removed nails holding glass in place
- [x] Smoking the shadow box glass (defuse the light)
      - 2 coast of Rust-oleum on each side to frost the glass
- [ ] Designing the LED mounts and aperature layers, and laser cutting the layers (special thanks to Al & Angi)
      - Process
        - Gravit Designer

        - 16 LEDs at 16.5mm/LED for a total of 264mm x 264mm centered (19mm edge)
        - Exported to SVG, imported into Adobe Illustrator, printed on xyz laser printer
    - Four layers
      Layer 1. LED Mount Panel (8.5mm x 8.5mm holes)
      Layers 2-4. Aperature Panel x3 (12.5mm x 12.5mm holes)
      How thick?
