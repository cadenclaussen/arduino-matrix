  - 1 layer with 16x16 small squares to mount the LED strips
  - 3 layers with 16x16 squares to create the aperature between the LEDs and the diffused glass
- Other
  - Scissors (to cut the LED strips)
  - Piers (to pull the nails from the shadow box)
  - Laser cutter
  - Duct tape (to secure LEDs onto LED mount)


## Process

- LED Prep
  - Cut the LEDs into 16 strips of 16 LEDs/strip
  - The WS2812 is an RGB LED with a WS2811 control IC built right into the LED

- Shadow box prep
  - Removed glass
  - Removed nails holding glass in place
  - 2 coast of Rust-oleum on each side to frost the glass

- LED Mounts
  - Process
    - Gravit Designer
    - 302mm x 302mm square (11 7/8" x 11 78")
    - 16 LEDs at 16.5mm/LED for a total of 264mm x 264mm centered (19mm edge)
    - Exported to SVG, imported into Adobe Illustrator, printed on xyz laser printer
  - Four layers
    - Layer 1. LED Mount Panel (8.5mm x 8.5mm holes)
    - Layers 2-4. Aperature Panel x3 (12.5mm x 12.5mm holes)
    - How thick?
    - Why type of wood?
